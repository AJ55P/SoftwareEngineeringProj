# Software Engineering Development Life Cycle Project


### **Description:**

1. Followed the iterative/agile SDLC process for developing a made up mine pump control system product(No Implementation/Coding/Testing).

2. Completed an SRS(Software Requirement Specification) document containing the functional and non-functional requirements, and architecture details for such a product.

3. Came up with possible use cases including information such as primary actors, certain conditions, exceptions, and etc. I then entered this in a specifications/descriptions file.

4. Also created the corresponding UML use case diagrams to go along with  it.

5. In addition, came up with object candidates and built the class diagrams to document them. As well as built the Sequence diagrams to represent and visualize the flow of control for actor and their possible actions between the mine pump control system.
